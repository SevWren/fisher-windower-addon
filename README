This addon doesn't actually fight the fish, it waits the provided catch
delay time and then injects a packet that tells the server the fish has
zero HP and you're pulling it up. When you start fishing, you need to
use the exact spelling and capitalization (quoted when spaces are
needed) the game uses for the bait and fish OR use item IDs. If the bite
ID for the fish is unknown it will catch every unknown fish/item/monster
using a very long catch delay until it finds the correct bite ID. You
can also cancel a fish on the line normally at any time.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Setting a reasonable catch delay is very important. This is the time it
will take to pull up your fish after you get a bite. Pulling up a
legendary fish 2 seconds after it bites is impossible normally and would
therefor draw attention from other players/GMs. Also setting it too low
will cause "lack of skill" messages. I would not recommend setting the
catch delay bellow 2 seconds even for fish that auto-drain instantly.

Fisher will automatically stop running under the following conditions:
    You reach the 200 fish catch limit for the day.
    You run out of bait.
    You run out of inventory space.
    An action is performed on you by a monster or another player.
    Your status changes.
    You receive a message from a GM.
    You perform an action.
    You change zones.
    You get a "You cannot fish here." error multiple times in a row.
